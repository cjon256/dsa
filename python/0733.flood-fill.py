#  An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image.
#
#  You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].
#
#  To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with color.
#
#  Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.
#
#
#  Example 1:
#
#  Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2
#  Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
#  Explanation: From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.
#  Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected to the starting pixel.
#
#
#  Example 2:
#
#  Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0
#  Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
#  Explanation: The starting pixel is already colored 0, so no changes are made to the image.
#
#
#
#  Constraints:
#
#
#  	m == image.length
#  	n == image[i].length
#  	1 <= m, n <= 50
#  	0 <= image[i][j], color < 2ยนโถ
#  	0 <= sr < m
#  	0 <= sc < n
