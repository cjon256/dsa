#  Write a function that takesÂ the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
#
#  Note:
#
#
#  	Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
#  	In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.
#
#
#
#  Example 1:
#
#  Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
#  Output: 3
#  Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
#
#
#  Example 2:
#
#  Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
#  Output: 1
#  Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
#
#
#  Example 3:
#
#  Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
#  Output: 31
#  Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
#
#
#
#  Constraints:
#
#
#  	The input must be a binary string of length 32.
#
#
#
#  Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
