# Requiresments for capturing cookies

- Tool for extracting [cookies](https://github.com/barnardb/cookies)
  install with `brew install barnardb/cookies/cookies`
- A browser (I use firefox dev edition for this)

Log into https://leetcode.com/ in the browser and then run the capture-cookies.py script
This will generate leetcode-creds.toml

Then run `make` to generate the final config files.
